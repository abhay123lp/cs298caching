IRCache is changing its policy for access to the sanitized log
files.  Commercial users of the data will be expected to pay for
access in order to help support the project.

Academic users will be given access at no cost.

All users are required to receive a username and password
so that we can enforce this policy.

For additional information, please contact
Duane Wessels <wessels@ircache.net>

Research/academic users, please answer the following questions:

    1. Please provide a brief description of your research.

    2. For how long do you need access to the log files?  When
       do you anticipate completing your work?

    3. If you have a web page that describes your work, please
       provide a URL.

    4. Do you plan to publish your results?  If so, please
       provide publication information if possible.
